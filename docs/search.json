      "contents": "\nAbout this project:\nMaine and New Hampshire have among the highest per capita reliance on\nprivate wells for drinking water in the United States (ME: 56% and NH:\n40%). Approximately 10% of Maine wells and 20% of New Hampshire wells\nhave elevated levels of arsenic, yet well water testing rates are low in\nboth states.\nIn August 2018, MDI Biological Laboratory received a 5-year NIH-NIGMS\nScience Education Partnership Award (SEPA) to create and pilot a\nnational model of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)\neducation. The project, “Data to Action: A Secondary School-Based\nCitizen Science Project to Address Arsenic Contamination of Well Water”\nengages students as citizen scientists and provides them with the tools\nand skills to make sense of data so that their results can lead to\nchange in their communities. This work will also help the region better\nunderstand the cycle of arsenic on agricultural land and in home\ngardens, and its potential effects on human health, from exposure such\nas eating produce, touching soil, or breathing in soil dust. You can\nread more about this project at this recent MDIBL\nblog post .\nMaximum Contaminant Levels: The numbers below are\nfederal standards set by the EPA for the maximum contaminant amount\nallowed in drinking water. These are set to protect public health. There\nare a few exceptions to the Maximum Contaminant Levels.\nBeryllium: 4 ug/L\nChromium: 100 ug/L\nManganese: 50 ug/L**\nIron: 300 ug/L**\nNickel: N/A\nCopper: 1300 ug/L*\nArsenic: 10 ug/L; New Hampshire lowered their MCL to 5 ug/L in\n2019.\nSelenium: 50 ug/L\nCadmium: 5 ug/L\nAntimony: 6 ug/L\nBarium: 2000 ug/L\nThallium: 2 ug/L\nLead: 15 ug/L\nUranium: 30 ug/L\n*Lead and Copper are regulated under an action level because they\nenter drinking water primarily through plumbing materials. Treatment at\nthe tap is recommended.\n**Iron and Manganese are “secondary standards” and not health\nthreatening. The EPA sets these standards because contaminants present\nin your water above these standards may cause your water to be\ndiscolored, taste odd, or have an odor. However, your water is still\nsafe to drink\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAbout this project:\nThe Great Green Crab Hunt: This project is part of a multi-pronged\neffort by NH Sea Grant to come up with solutions to controlling the\ninvasive European green crab, Carcinas meanas, which has been causing\necological and economic damage to northern New England for decades. With\nincreasing ocean temperatures the region is seeing an explosion in the\ngreen crab population in recent years and as a result we have been\nworking with regional partners on several avenues of mitigating the\ninvasion. One solution is to create markets and a viable fishery/\nremoval program to supply a soft-shell crab industry similar to the\nsoft-shell blue crab industry in the southern US. One method to help\nstreamline and increase awareness and interest in the problem as well as\nfinding hotspots of large aggregations of crabs that are molting or\nabout to molt, is through this citizen science monitoring program, The\nGreat Green Crab Hunt.\nYou can also access the New Hampshire invasive green crab\ndataset and read a 2021 MDIBL blog post about a MDIBL volunteers\nwork combing through historical\ngreen crab data records.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAbout this project:\nThe Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest heating bodies of water on\nthe planet. With its shallow depth and shape, making it especially\nsusceptible to warming. It is important to monitor the changes in the\nmarine ecosystems to understand how they are currently and may continue\nto respond to perturbations. This has implications for the marine\necology and fisheries of the region including potentially changes to the\ntiming, type, and intensity of harmful algal blooms (or HABS for\nshort).\nIn Frenchmans Bay some species of the dinoflagellates\nAlexandrium are known to produce a highly potent neurotoxin\ncalled saxitoxin.\nShellfish filter feed on these microbes and accumulate the toxin and\nwhen people eat the toxin filled shellfish it can cause paralytic\nshellfish poisoning. The presence of any Alexandrium can necessitate\nfisheries closures because of the associated public health risk.\nSimilarly some species of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia can\nproduce a different neurotoxin called domoic\nacid, which is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning. When\nhumans, birds, or various marine mammals consume affected shellfish it\neffects brain function and cau cause seizures and in some cases death.\nIn pop-culture a 1961 HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia led seabirds to\nattach local residents of a shore community and was influential in the\ncreating of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film The\nBirds\nThe Community Environmental Health Lab has been monitoring the\npresence and abundance of HAB species and other phytoplankton for over\ntwo decades. Currently the data collected are included in a larger HAB\nmonitoring program run through the Maine Department of Marine Resources\nprogram.\nThe current HAB target species of concern include:\nAlexandrium\nDinophysis acuminata\nDinophysis norvegica\nGonyaulax\nKarenia\nMargalefidinium polykrikoides (formerly known as Cochlodinium)\nProrocentrumlima\nPseudo-nitzschia\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe MDI Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) is launching a citizen science\nprogram aimed at understanding the effectiveness of COVID-19 home test\nkits in detecting the SARS CoV-2 virus. Using MDIBL’s citizen science\ndata platform, Anecdata.org, participants over the age of 18 will be\nasked to fill out a brief anonymous survey, providing information on\nsymptoms, masking, which kind of test kit was used, and the test\nresult.\nJane Disney, Ph.D., who leads the project said, “It will provide very\npractical information that will inform our understanding of community\nspread as SARS CoV-2 and its subvariants continue to infect people\nworldwide. This survey tool will help us address critical questions\nabout the relationship between timing of exposure, whether a mask was\nworn, what type of mask was worn, symptoms, and results of different\nCovid-19 home test kits. The anonymous results are publicly available\nfor download so that people can see what is happening in their\ncommunities.”\nThe US government recently provided guidance that requires private\ninsurance companies to cover the costs of up to eight FDA approved over\nthe counter COVID-19 diagnostic tests per household. Therefore,\nadministration of these tests is happening privately, and test results\nare largely unreported. Disney added, “This leaves a great gap in\nknowledge about the transmission of the virus. MDIBL is pleased to\nassist in tracing infections in this way and working on behalf of the\npublic good.”\nIf you are interested in taking part of this Citizen Science\nproject that will provide valuable data to researchers, you can learn\nmore about and participate in the project, [here](https://www.anecdata.org/projects/view/covid-19-home-testing.\n\n\n\n",

Each week, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, volunteers and\nstaff from the Community Environmental Health Lab at MDIBL and Acadia\nNational Park test many of the most popular swim spots on MDI.\nEach sample is collected using EPA-approved quality assured\nprotocols. Samples on MDI are brought to the Community Lab at MDIBL to\nbe analyzed for Enterococcous, a fecal indicator bacteria.\nFecal indicator bacteria are associated with the fecal material from\nhumans and other warm-blooded animals; MHB uses this as an indicator\nbecause there are far too many pathogens to test for individually. If\nEnterococcus is present, then other pathogens are likely present as\nwell.\nPeople can become ill after swallowing or other contact with\ncontaminated water; symptoms are typically gastrointestinal,\nrespiratory, or skin related. According to MHB, moderate to heavy\nrainfall (1” or more in a 24-hour period) is often associated with an\nincreased risk of bacterial contamination, so precautionary rainfall\nadvisories are posted.\nOther pathogenic sources include:\nImproperly disposed of diapers\nChildren not properly cleaned after using the bathroom\nSwimmers with diarrhea\nA vomiting or fecal accident in the water\nWaste from wildlife, domestic animals, and pets\nMalfunctioning subsurface wastewater disposal (septic) or sanitary\ncollection (sewage treatment plant) systems\nBoats discharging sewage into the water\nContaminated stormwater runoff\nBefore your next beach day, check for beach advisories or closures\nat participating beaches by visiting the Current\nBeach Status webpage, or, when you get to the beach, look for the\nMaine Healthy Beaches sign – advisories and closures will be physically\nposted.\nThe Community Enivoronmental Health Lab’s related data is also\navailable through our Anecdata portal.\n\n\n\n",

Is this school-based\napproach more impactful than other types of community interventions?\nWhat skills and supports do teachers and students need to realize this\noutcome? Does engagement with locally relevant issues provide incentive\nfor learning and improve learning outcomes? How do these experiences\nimpact self-efficacy and interest in Science, Technology, Engineering\nand Math (STEM) careers? These are central questions of the Science\nEducation Partnership Award (SEPA) project.\nAs an outgrowth of this project, the Community Lab is collaborating\nwith researchers across multiple disciplines to understand seasonality\nof arsenic and other metals in well water. Heavy metals can contaminate\nprivate wells through geogenic sources and surface water seepage and\nrun-off after storm events. People who are exposed to heavy metals via\ntheir well water risk acute and chronic toxicity, liver, kidney, and\nintestinal damage and cancer. Through repeated visits to well owners, we\nare comparing well water “toxic metal fingerprints” over time and\nspatial scales and are discovering that every well has its own story.\nHomeowners may need to know their “well story” to implement the most\nappropriate mitigation measures to prevent toxic metal exposure and\nrelated diseases.\nThe Community Lab is working with additional collaborators to develop\napproaches to identifying which well water samples collected by citizen\nscientists may have negative health impacts on the consumer. Are EPA\ndrinking water standards for individual metals sufficient for\ndetermining drinking water safety? Our findings suggest that metal\nmixtures may need to be taken into consideration. We plan health history\nfollow-ups with well owners to help inform future public health\nrecommendations and actions.\n\n\n\n",
