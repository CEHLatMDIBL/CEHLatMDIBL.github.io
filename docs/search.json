      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity\nEnvironmental Health Lab at MDIBL\nDr. Jane E Disney Associate Professor of Environmental\nHealth\nCan engaging students in collecting well water samples for toxic\nmetal analysis and sharing their findings with their communities result\nin changed behaviors and improved public health? Is this school-based\napproach more impactful than other types of community interventions?\nWhat skills and supports do teachers and students need to realize this\noutcome? Does engagement with locally relevant issues provide incentive\nfor learning and improve learning outcomes? How do these experiences\nimpact self-efficacy and interest in Science, Technology, Engineering\nand Math (STEM) careers? These are central questions of the Science\nEducation Partnership Award (SEPA) project.\nAs an outgrowth of this project, the Community Lab is collaborating\nwith researchers across multiple disciplines to understand seasonality\nof arsenic and other metals in well water. Heavy metals can contaminate\nprivate wells through geogenic sources and surface water seepage and\nrun-off after storm events. People who are exposed to heavy metals via\ntheir well water risk acute and chronic toxicity, liver, kidney, and\nintestinal damage and cancer. Through repeated visits to well owners, we\nare comparing well water “toxic metal fingerprints” over time and\nspatial scales and are discovering that every well has its own story.\nHomeowners may need to know their “well story” to implement the most\nappropriate mitigation measures to prevent toxic metal exposure and\nrelated diseases.\nThe Community Lab is working with additional collaborators to develop\napproaches to identifying which well water samples collected by citizen\nscientists may have negative health impacts on the consumer. Are EPA\ndrinking water standards for individual metals sufficient for\ndetermining drinking water safety? Our findings suggest that metal\nmixtures may need to be taken into consideration. We plan health history\nfollow-ups with well owners to help inform future public health\nrecommendations and actions.\n\n\n\n",
