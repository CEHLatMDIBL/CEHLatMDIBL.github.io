The Green Crab Studies project contributes to efforts across New England to track the invasive European green crab, *Carcinas meanas*. With a lack of predators, this invasive species has destroyed eelgrass beds and damaged fisheries across the region. More information on green crab population dynamics and movements are needed for researchers and scientists to develop effective mitigation strategies. You can access the [Green Crab Studies dataset](https://www.anecdata.org/projects/view/34) on the Community Labâ€™s citizen science data portal, Anecdata. There is another green crab monitoring project on Anecdata called the Great Green Crab Hunt, which takes place in  New Hampshire, you can also download data from this [invasive green crab dataset](https://anecdata.org/projects/view/521) and read a 2021 MDIBL blog post about a MDIBL volunteers work combing through [historical green crab data records](https://mdibl.org/this-is-why-volunteer-mike-hays/).
